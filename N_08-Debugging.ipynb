    "# Notebook 08 - A Short Primer on Debugging\n",
    "Code development is a rewarding experience which can provide great short-term reward. On the flip side, code which does not behave as anticipated can be an extremely frustrating experience. And there we are, debugging and starting to brain-loop over our own code. This section will provide few tips and pointers on how to investigate your faulty code and hopefully reduce your frustrations.\n",

    "## The Poorman debugger\n",
    "A very common approach to debugging is to scatter `print()` statements all over your code. Python is great for that purpose as it natively understands how to print almost any object it creates. This approach is easy, but not particularly efficient when one deals with large arrays. We'll try to cover a few scenarios and give you a few better strategies for debugging your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Debugging modules\n",
    "When debugging modules, it is important to import them again after changes are made. Unfortunately, the way to reload modules has changed a few times and evolved depending on which version of Python you are running. For Python version after 3.4, this is done using the `importlib` module as `import` will not re-import a module already imported. Let's see how this works in practice with a very simple example. Another way to re-import a module is to restart your kernel all together, but this is not always practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will learn how to import modules from subdirectories. Here, the module *faultyModule* is located in a directory called *Code_08*. Just notice how the directory becomes considered as a unifying module."

This allows us to slowly step through the code (using the 's' command). The displayed '->' in the source code shows where the execution is at. One step and we enter the run() function. One more and we land on variable 'c' that is getting initialized. Bad name, as it would conflict with the c(ontinue) command of the debugger if we were to interrogate its value. Its value, however,  can still be displayed using `print(c)` at the debugger's prompt. Now let's use 'n' to avoid going down in the rabbit hole of called sub functions.\n",

    "- Our first step into `runner.answer()` lands on line 15 on the `answer()` definition. It doesn't look like the `total` variable is correctly adding the values of the dice.\n",
    "- Jump into the `for` loop on line 18 by either setting a breakpoint and continue, or using next a few times.\n",
    "- Use `dir(die)` to check whether a `die` has an attibute which would contain its value. \n",
    "- We can compare the value of the die with what is shown using `die.value` and `die.show()`. Note that the `\\n` characters can be interpreted using `print(die.show())`. Value and die seem to match. The error is that total does not properly add values while it is iterating over the dice. We found one bug and its solution so that you now know how to fix the `answer()` method.\n",
