    "- Make plots to visualize the data \n",
    "    - Use everything you have learned so far using Matplotlib\n",
    "- Use linear regression to predict one of the variables from one or both of the others\n",
    "- Calculate statistics on the data\n",
    "    - You can use the Numpy or Pandas modules, both have a lot of statistical functions. \n",
