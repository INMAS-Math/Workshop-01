While a jupyter notebook is a great tool for interactive scripting, writing tutorials, as well as code prototyping, larger projects are typically characterized by Python modules shared amongst team members. In view of facilitating the integration of the multiple contributors involved in a given project, it is often necessary adopting the following best practices.\n",

    "As Python is a very flexible language, there are often multiple ways to achieve the same goal. For example, a simple loop can be coded by using an index,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(len(x)):\n",
    "```\n",
    "or using an iterator,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for item in x:\n",
    "```\n",
    "or even with a forever loop such as\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "with an appropriate `break` condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "- It is recommended to use iterators whenever possible. In a few situations, however, iterators can lead to problems. What are these cases?\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this introduction is not to propose a given coding standard, but rather to make you aware that coding standards exist and that you should (1) think about adopting a given style in your own Python scripts and (2) inquire about the existence of such standard in your future assignments. A good place to start is to read the de facto __[guide to Python scripting](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)__ (known as PEP 8) from the author of Python himself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",

    "Coding standards are intrinsically boring but are a necessary tool in team environments. Fortunately, __[automated tools](https://github.com/life4/awesome-python-code-formatters)__ exist for reformating the code in order to comply with parts of the standard involving where to put spaces (or not). As an example, using `yapf` (yet another Python formatter, from Google) on the following (ugly) code:\n",

    "Another boring topic is documentation. Prototypical codes are generally poorly documented as the code is in a constant state of change. Python offers mutliple ways by which code can be documented as it gets written, specifically named arguments and doc strings for functions and modules.

The main customer of your code is you: make sure you will be able to understand your own code 6 months after not seeing it.\n",

    "The Jupyter Notebook allows for checkpoints and the ability to recall previous versions. In team environments, `git` is often the preferred tool for incorporating contributions from the various team members.

A good place to start is to read a __[short tutorial](https://git-scm.com/doc)__ on git and install it on your computer. This __[web site](https://git-scm.com/)__ is the main resource for `git` source code management tool. There are also multiple websites (e.g, __[github](https://github.com/)__, __[gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)__, ...) that can host your project for free.

    "Once we develop our own modules, it is important to define tests that verify the conditions of use of our new algorithms. In most team environments, contributors are asked to run all tests before pushing their changes to the common code repository. As an additional incentive, source code management tools (subversion, git, etc.) have a 'blame' functionality for assigning the responsibility of a broken code to the individual who made the faulty changes. The action to test a function in isolation is called __unit testing__ while the action of testing the ensemble, i.e., how the functions interact with one another, is called __regression testing__.

Let's start with a case where it works: Say that we have the following function which normalizes a 3D vector that we represent as a tuple.

    "Congratulations on your first test! These test functions would typically reside in a module called, say, test_mytrig if your library was mytrig. Once written, these tests can be automated and run before each time you commit new code to make sure that your new shiny features have not broken anything in the existing software framework. Automation can be implemented with various tools, including the `unittest` library, but these topics are beyond the scope of this introductory tutorial. These libraries also have the benefit to provide broader comparison functions such as `assertEqual()` which detect the type of object (float, vs boolean, integer, tuple, dicts, etc.) and behave accordingly.\n",

Another interesting approach of testing is design through testing, unlike the typical waterfall method, which consists of designing sofware to meet some pre-defined capabilitities and implementing it. __[Test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)__ can be a great way to accelerate your project.\n",
