    "# Notebook 08 - A Short Primer on Debugging\n",
    "Code development is a rewarding experience which can provide great short-term reward. On the flip side, code which does not behave as anticipated can be an extremely frustrating experience. And there we are, debugging and starting to brain-loop over our own code. This section will provide few tips and pointers on how to investigate your faulty code and hopefully reduce your frustrations.\n",

    "## The Poorman Debugger\n",
    "A very common approach to debugging is to scatter `print()` statements all over your code. Python is great for that purpose as it natively understands how to print almost any object it creates. This approach is easy, but not particularly efficient as one deals with large arrays. We'll try to cover a few scenarios and give you a few better strategies for debugging your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Debugging modules\n",
    "When debugging modules, it is important to import them again after changes are made. Unfortunately, the way to reload modules has changed a few times and evolved depending on which version of Python you are running. For Python version after 3.4, this is done using the `importlib` module as `import` will not re-import a module already imported. Let's see how this works in practice with a very simple example. Another way to re-import a module is to restart your kernel all together, but this is not always practical."
