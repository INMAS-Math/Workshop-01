    "In this module you will learn the basics of software engineering and best practices typically used in the industry. While a jupyter notebook is a great tool for interactive scripting, writing tutorials, as well as code prototyping, larger projects are typically characterized by Python modules shared amongst team members. In view of facilitating the integration of the multiple contributors involved in a given project, it is often necessary adopting the following best practices.\n",

    "As Python is a very flexible language, there are often multiple ways to achieve the same goal. For example, a simple loop can be coded by using an index,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(len(x)):\n",
    "```\n",
    "or using an iterator,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for item in x:\n",
    "```\n",
    "or even with a forever loop such as\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "with an appropriate `break` condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "- It is recommended to use iterators whenever possible. In a few situations, however, iterators can lead to problems. What are these cases?\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this introduction is not to propose a given coding standard, but rather to make you aware that coding standards exist and that you should (1) think about adopting a given style in your own Python scripts and (2) inquire about the existence of such standard in your future assignments. A good place to start is to read the de facto __[guide to Python scripting](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)__ (known as PEP 8) from the author of Python himself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "- Take a few minutes to browse the PEP 8 and discuss the situation when a line break is required for an expression too long to fit on a single line. Should the line break be before or after a binary operator?\n",

    "Coding standards are intrinsically boring but are a necessary tool in team environments. Fortunately, __[automated tools](https://github.com/life4/awesome-python-code-formatters)__ exist for reformating the code in order to comply with parts of the standard involving where to put spaces (or not). As an example, using `yapf` (yet another Python formatter, from Google) on the following (ugly) code:\n",

    "  return      37+-+a[42-x :  y**3]\n",

    "Another unpopular topic is documentation. Prototypical codes are generally poorly documented as the code is in a constant state of change. Python offers mutliple ways by which code can be documented as it gets written, specifically named arguments and doc strings for functions and modules. Make it a habit to use descriptive names for variables and named arguments. The main customer of your code is you: make sure you will be able to understand your own code 6 months after not seeing it.\n",

    "## Version Control\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook allows for checkpoints and the ability to recall previous versions. In team environments, `git` is often the preferred tool for incorporating contributions from the various team members. The basic functionality of `git` is relatively simple to master and might even be useful to you when you start writing your thesis in LaTeX. A good place to start is to read a __[short tutorial](https://git-scm.com/doc)__ on git and install it on your computer. This __[web site](https://git-scm.com/)__ is the main resource for `git` source code management tool. There are also multiple websites (e.g, __[github](https://github.com/)__, __[gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)__, ...) that can host your project for free. Industries most often use an internal server for that purpose.\n",

    "## Modules, Parameter Files, and Command Line Basics\n",
    "Software reusability can significantly reduce development costs. The main mechanism by which code can be re-used in Python is through modules. In this section we will go beyond the Jupyter notebook and implement a few modules from the command line. To start, open a terminal window using the Anaconda powershell on Windows or the equivalent on macOs or Linux. Let's first see if Python is in your path by running:\n",

    "- 'pwd' Print working directory\n",
    "- 'cd where' Change directory to 'where'\n",
    "- 'mkdir newdir' Make a new directory called 'newdir'\n",

    "Most scripts require (re-)configurable parameters to run. When using single-file Jupyter notebook, these values might end up being hardcoded in the file. For re-usability of the code, it is beneficial to isolate the parameters that will make the algorithm more universally re-usable.

    "## Unit and Regression Testing\n",
    "Once we develop our own modules, it is important to define tests that verify the conditions of use of our new algorithms. In most team environments, contributors are asked to run all tests before pushing their changes to the common code repository. As an additional incentive, source code management tools (subversion, git, etc.) have a 'blame' functionality for assigning the responsibility of a broken code to the individual who made the faulty changes. The action to test a function in isolation is called __unit testing__ while the action of testing the ensemble, i.e., how the functions interact with one another, is called __regression testing__. Let's look at our newly created module to read parameters as an example.\n",

    "- duplicate entries\n",
    "- missing or poorly formatted assignments\n",
    "- lines starting with a '#' and treat them as comments\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now introduce the common approach to write unit tests in Python. These tests are themselves boolean functions starting with the 'test_' keyword and typically living in a separate file located in the same directory as your module. In the interest of time, we will use simple numerical examples to illustrate how to proceed. Before we start, however, we need to discuss an important point about float comparison. Let's start with a case where it works: Say that we have the following function which normalizes a 3D vector that we represent as a tuple. (This function is already available in numpy and is only used as a short representative example here)."

    "To answer the second question, we use a comparison involving floating numbers. We can get away with this comparison here, but in most other cases, we must use something more sophisticated. For that purpose, the concept of machine epsilon is necessary: this is the floating number which added to unity will return unity due to numerical inaccuraries.

    "Congratulations on your first test! These test functions would typically reside in a module called, say, test_mytrig if your library was mytrig. Once written, these tests can be automated and run before each time you commit new code to make sure that your new shiny features have not broken anything in the existing software framework. Automation can be implemented with various tools, including the `unittest` library, but these topics are beyond the scope of this introductory tutorial. These libraries also have the benefit to provide broader comparison functions such as `assertEqual()` which detect the type of object (float, vs boolean, integer, tuple, dicts, etc.) and behave accordingly.\n",
